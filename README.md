# Unmanned-aerial-vehicle-using-wire-less-sensor-networks
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is more important because UAVs can be broadly used for complex tasks like disaster relief operations, border patrol, and atmospheric surveillance.

Localization of sensor node is decisive for many localization-based scenarios of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Node localization using fixed terrestrial anchor nodes (ANs) equipped with global positioning system (GPS) modules suffers from high deployment cost and poor localization accuracy, because the terrestrial AN propagates signals to the unknown nodes (UNs) through unreliable ground- to-ground channel. However, the ANs deployed in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a single GPS module communicate over reliable air-to-ground channel, where almost clear line-of-sight path exists.
Thus, the localization accuracy anddeployment cost are better with aerial anchors than terrestrial anchors. 

However, still the nonlinear distortions imposed in propagation channel limit the performance of classical RSSI and least square localization schemes. So, the neural network (NN) models can become good alternative for node localization under such nonlinear conditions as they can do complex nonlinear mapping between input and output. Since the multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a robust tool in the assembly of NNs, MLP-based localization scheme is proposed for UN localization in UAV- aided WSNs. The detailed simulation analysis provided in this paper prefers the MLP localization scheme as they exhibit improved localization accuracy and deployment


1. INTRODUCTION
  1.1 OBJECTIVE
  The global positioning system (GPS) used for localizing nodes in outdoor environment is limited due to poor energy management and implementation cost. In GPS-based localization, it is necessary to   exist a perfect line of sight (LOS) from satellite-to-sensor node.
  The multimodal sensor nodes can be placed either systematically or randomly in a given sensor field. During sensing certain phenomena, one should also know where it has happened. If the location     of the node sensing a specific event is unidentified, then discovering such event becomes useless. Discovering node location is usually called as localization

  1.2 MOTIVATION
  India is one of the large countries in terms of area. In the future generation of communications networks, real-time localization and position-based services are required that are accurate, low      cost, energy efficient and reliable. Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can be applied in many applications, such as natural resources investigation, targets tracking, unapproachable places   monitoring and so forth.
  
  In these applications, the information is collected and transferred by the sensor nodes. Various applications request these sensor nodesâ€™ location information. Moreover, the location information     is also indispensable in geographic routing protocols and clustering . All these mentioned above make localization algorithms become one of the most important issues in WSNs researches. Thus,        locations of sensor nodes are important for operations in WSNs.
  Localization in WSNs has been intensively studied in recent years, with most of these studies relying on the condition that only a small proportion of sensor nodes, called anchor nodes, know their   exact positions through GPS devices or manual configuration . Other sensor nodes estimate their distances to anchor nodes and calculate positions with multi- lateration techniques.
